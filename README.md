# Region Chat

Ever tried to have a conversation with someone whilst Barbarian Fishing, only to have it cut short by an impromptu split due to the fishing spot moved? Separated at Tempoross due to being sent different ships?

This plugin is for you! This plugin ensures that your chat will reach one another, so long as you're in the same rough area. Currently this plugin will work for the following areas:

* Barbarian Fishing south of Barbarian Outpost
* The Tempoross Island
